                        Hello! We are Sally and Harry and we are pleased to introduce ourselves. We met at Art College where we hit it off over a shared interest in sculpting. 
                        It wasnt long before we started working as a team with a goal of creating a local handcrafted and sustainable pottery brand.
                        We had discovered and fallen in love with the Dingle peninsula during their travels to art shows and craft fairs and so decided that it was home for us.  
                        Wild Atlantic Wares was founded in our little studio just west of Dingle town in 2010, a point at which sustainablity and environmental issues were to the forefront. 
                        Our pottery is inspired by the nature that surounds us and is brought to life using sustainable and environmently friendly practices, a commitment that is very important to us. 
                        Our raw matreials are sourced locally, our kiln is powrered by solar energy and all our pacakging is 100% recyclable.
